## TIC TAC TOE 4 Android ##
TicTacToe4Android is an open source hobby project for developing tictactoe game for android phones. As of now, we have developed a full-fledged tictactoe game with Vs Human and Vs Computer modes and 6 themes.




## Project Background ##
We did this project during May-Aug 2009, for ADC 2 submission. After the submission, we thought of making it Open Source for further development as **better ideas would contribute to better Applications.**

Since most of the story behind the development of this app is posted in our blogs, we thought of providing you with those links too (in case you are interested !!)
